"Which is denser, water vapor or air?",,"Water vapor is the densest. Air is not dens. Water is a mixture of both. It is also the most dense. The air is heavier than water. But water is lighter than air. So, the air has more mass than the water, and therefore, it",,"Air
The answer you are looking for is Air.  Air has the highest density.",Air is denser than water vapor
"Which is denser, water vapor or air?",,"Water vapor is the densest substance. It's denseness is determined by the amount of water molecules in the atmosphere. Air is a gas and is not a substance, so it's not as dense. But water is very dense and it has a lot of atoms. So",,"Air
The answer here is Air. This is because Air doesn't have the same mass as Water. You can't make Air heavier by adding water to it. Also, Air can only have one form. A liquid, which is why it's called liquid water (water",Air is denser than water vapor
"Which is denser, water vapor or air?",,"Water vapor is more dense than air. Water is a liquid, and air is an air molecule. The air molecules are in the form of a gas. Air molecules in water are not air, but rather water molecules. A gas is made up of molecules of two or more",,"air
The answer should be air because air isn't a pure gas but a
combination of gases, i.e. water + air = air + water = water

it's not",Air is denser than water vapor
"Which is denser, water vapor or air?",,"Water vapor is the most dense. It's also densest, but it's not as dense as air. You'll see that air is much densier than water. The reason is that water is more dense than air and it absorbs heat. Air absorbers more than",,"Air
You have to think of it as a fluid. A fluid has many properties, like density, viscosity, etc.  
An air-vapour mixture will have the properties of an air/vortex. Vapors will tend to move in a direction",Air is denser than water vapor
"Which is denser, water vapor or air?",,"Water vapor is the densest. The density of water is about
10.8 pounds per cubic foot. Air is air. That is why it is named air
and not water. It is still air, even though it has a density
of about 3.2",,"Air
To answer this question, we can just compare the densities of the two gases (which is what we do when we mix them).
Because air was originally liquid, when it was mixed with a larger amount of liquid (water) it had a lower density. However",Air is denser than water vapor
