1) There are many and different ways of measuring the energy of the particles that enter the detectors. Some of them use the luminosities of electrons, positrons and muons. Other ways use energy and momentum",,"It's been named after Enzo Ferrari, Enrica Ferrari (1892-1977), who
  founded the organisation and gave the code for its name. Since
1973, it has expanded to include many other centres of research,
