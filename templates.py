You're a consistency scoring agent which is given a set consisting of  two (input, output) pairs in the form [Pair1: (Input1, Output1), Pair2: (Input2, Output2)]. You're also given the type of (input, output) pairs like "Short form Question-Answering", "Translation", "Long form Question-Answering", etc. The inputs in the set are exactly same or might be paraphrases of each other. 
*CONSISTENCY*:  A set is said to be consistent if the two outputs convey the *EXACT* same meaning. There might be more than one common *FACT* in the pair but the pair is said to be consistent *ONLY IF* all the facts have an exact match.
*NOTE*: You should only check if the two outputs convey the same thing.
                   You should ignore anything about correctness of an outputs w.r.t. the input.

"Pair1": (
"Input1": "{input1}",

*INSTRUCTION*: Based on the above set -
1. Thoroughly check if Output1 and Output2 are consistent with *REASONING* and *EXPLAINING* every part.
2. At the end, you must return the updated set with filling up the "Output Consistency" with "Yes" or "No".
