Fortune cookies are believed to have originated in San Francisco in the early 1900s. Although a similar baked item existed in Japan for centuries, several different people have claimed to be the creator of the modern-day fortune cookie.","

Fortune cookies are believed to have originated in 19th-century Japan, where a traditional cracker was made from flour, sugar, and sesame and was similar to a modern-day tea biscuit. In the early 20th century, Japanese immigrants in California created a version of these cookies that included a message with a bit of fortune-telling advice. The custom of including colorful messages with the cookies spread to the United States in 1910 and today, the fortune cookie is considered an iconic treat in Chinese-American cuisine.",2.3573560611112043e-05

Veins appear blue because the oxygen-depleted blood in them absorbs longer-wavelength colors, such as red, and reflects back shorter-wavelength colors, such as blue. The color of veins is affected by the amount of oxygen-rich and oxygen-depleted blood in them.","

Veins appear blue because of a combination of factors. The oxygen-rich blood that travels through veins is a darker color than oxygen-depleted blood, which is carried through arteries. When the blood reflects off the skin and flows back, the skin acts as a blue filter and makes the veins appear blue. In addition, the thickness of the vein walls and the amount of light reflecting off of them can affect the color. Sunlight makes the veins appear more blue, while fluorescent lighting can make them appear more green.",1.4453990843321662e-05

Veins appear blue because of something known as Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering causes the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue, to scatter more strongly off particles in the air, reflecting an overall bluish color. When we look at our veins, the blue light is reflecting off of the oxygen-depleted blood back to our eyes.","

The blue color of veins is caused by the combination of two factors: the color of the surrounding tissues, and the way light is scattered by the blood within the veins. The tissues surrounding the veins are of a bluish color, while the red blood cells found within them disperse the light in a way that creates a blue appearance.",0.00012082418106729165

Veins appear blue because the wavelength of the light that is reflected is closer to blue than red. Blood in veins appears blue because it is being transmitted away from the heart and being deoxygenated. The deoxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more blue light when compared to red, making the veins appear blue.","

The sky and oceans appear blue because of an effect known as Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules of air, which scatter the sunlight in different directions. The shorter blue wavelengths of visible light scatters the most, which is why the sky and the oceans appear blue. Similarly, this is also why veins appear blue under the skin - due to the same effect of light being scattered off red blood cells that are closest to the surface of the skin.",3.381858914508484e-05

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, it would likely cause a serious injury. A penny dropped from 1,454 feet would be travelling at speeds upwards of 170 miles per hour when it reached the ground, and would have the kinetic energy equal to that of a 5.3 pound object dropped from shoulder height. The impact could easily cause a broken bone or other serious injury.","

If you were hit by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, the consequences would be severe. The penny would be traveling at nearly the speed of sound, around 770 miles per hour, and would cause significant trauma and possibly even death due to the extreme force of the impact. If the penny did not cause immediate death, the person hit would almost certainly experience traumatic injury that would require emergency medical attention.",0.00036162487231194973

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, it could cause serious injury. As the penny will be travelling at a very high velocity from the top of a building that tall, it could cause a severe impact upon impact. It could break bones, cause lacerations, concussion, and other such physical injuries.","

It is not possible for a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building to reach terminal velocity due to air resistance. Therefore, if a penny were dropped from the summit of the Empire State Building, it would not accelerate enough to cause any serious damage or injury to a person if they were hit by it.",7.941541116451845e-05

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, the impact would likely not harm you. However, the penny would have been travelling very quickly and may cause injury or discomfort depending on where it hits you.","

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the summit of the Empire State Building, the result would depend on the speed at which it was travelling when it hit you. If it had enough speed, you could suffer a minor injury from being struck, such as a bruise or abrasion. If the penny was travelling very quickly, however, there is potential for more serious injury.",6.269650475587696e-05

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, the penny would have acquired so much velocity on its way down that it would most likely cause serious injury. At a height of 1,250 feet, the penny could theoretically reach a speed up to 200 mph by the time it reaches the ground. The impact of such a high-speed penny would be similar to the effect of a bullet, which could cause internal injuries and even death.","

The consequence of being hit by a penny that fell from the summit of the Empire State Building would most likely be death or severe injuries due to the large distance the penny would have to fall (1,453ft), and the massive terminal velocity the penny would reach (about 200 mph).",0.00010791199747473001

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, the impact could cause injury, potential internal bleeding, or even death. The penny would reach a terminal velocity of around 200 miles per hour by the time it reached the ground, making it much heavier and more powerful than a penny thrown by hand.","

If you were hit by a penny that fell from the summit of the Empire State Building, the most likely consequence would be a minor injury. While the penny itself would not cause a significant amount of damage, the force of the impact, combined with the speed at which the penny would be traveling, could still be enough to inflict a minor cut or bruise upon impact.",6.553853017976508e-05

If a penny were dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, the penny would reach a terminal velocity and reach speeds of over 100 miles per hour. If that penny struck a person it would cause significant damage, depending upon where it struck and the size of the person - it could cause a serious injury, or even be fatal.","

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the summit of the Empire State Building, the outcome would depend on the speed at which it was dropped. At the height of the Empire State Building, such a penny could reach terminal velocity, meaning it could be falling fast enough that air resistance counters the force of gravity and its speed levels off. In this case, the penny would likely cause a minor injury, such as a minor bruise, depending on where you were struck. If the penny was dropped without reaching terminal velocity, its speed upon impact would decrease notably, making injury less likely.",6.497473805211484e-05

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, the outcome would depend on a number of factors. If the penny was lying flat and struck you directly, it could cause a minor injury depending on where it hits you. If the penny was spinning or tumbling when it hit you, the potential for injury or damage would be greater due to an increased impact force. The penny would also be traveling at an extremely high velocity when it hit you, making it potentially very dangerous.","

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the summit of the Empire State Building, the impact would be negligible. Even though the penny can reach a terminal velocity of upwards of 200 miles per hour as it is falling, it is still only a penny and would have minimal impact upon impact with a person. The penny would have lost most of its velocity due to air resistance by the time it reached you, so it would likely be more of a nuisance than anything else.",5.3989300795365125e-05

If you were struck by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building it would hurt greatly, but not cause any serious injury. The penny would reach a maximum terminal velocity of ~50-60 miles per hour, meaning it would be released with roughly the same force as an adult standing arm’s length away and throwing the penny at you. Even if the penny were to strike unprotected skin, the most likely result would be a bruise or slight abrasion.","

If you were hit by a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, the penny could cause serious injury. A penny dropped from that distance would have a velocity of around 50 mph, which could cause bruising and possibly even fracture a bone.",4.928766065859236e-05
